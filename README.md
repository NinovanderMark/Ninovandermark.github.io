# Nino's Personal Pages
This is my personal website, it's still a work in progress but I'm hoping to put up articles,
tutorials and links to interesting projects. It's generated using [HTML Templater](https://github.com/NinovanderMark/HtmlTemplater), a static site generator.

If you have comments, critiques or ideas, feel free to reach out to me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ninovandermark) or [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ninovandermark.bsky.social).
